Rain stopped and the street became a mirror.
A little sparrow shook raindrops from its wings.
Lena stepped over puddles like hopping on tiny islands.
She saw a rainbow hiding behind the clouds.
Grandpa said rain washes the dust so colors can sing.
They listened to the quiet drip from the leaves.
Lena took a deep breath and felt the world turn light.
She saved a small puddle reflection in her heart.
