Mina found a tiny seed in her pocket.
Grandma smiled and said it was a memory seed.
They planted it in a small cup by the window.
Every morning Mina whispered a happy memory to the seed.
One day a bud appeared, bright and gentle.
The flower bloomed and smelled like warm pancakes.
Mina realized memories grow when we share them.
She gave a petal to her brother to start his own memory flower.
